This repository provides examples for running AI models and applications on NVIDIA Jetson devices.  For generative AI, it supports a variety of examples including text generation, image generation, vision transformers, vector databases, and audio models.
To run the examples, you need to install the jetson-examples package and use the Seeed Studio [reComputer](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4012-p-5586.html), the edge AI device powered by Jetson Orin.  The repo aims to make it easy to deploy state-of-the-art AI models, with just one line of command, on Jetson devices for tasks like language understanding, computer vision, and multimodal processing.

This repo builds upon the work of the [Jetson Containers](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers), which provides a modular container build system for various AI/ML packages on NVIDIA Jetson devices. It also leverages resources and tutorials from the [Jetson Generative AI Lab](https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/index.html), which showcases bringing generative AI to the edge, powered by Jetson hardware.

## Install

```sh
pip install jetson-examples
```

- [more installation methods](./docs/install.md)
- If you have already installed, you can use `pip install jetson-examples --upgrade` to update.

## Quickstart

To run and chat with [LLaVA](https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/tutorial_llava.html):

```sh
reComputer run llava
```

## Example list

reComputer supports a list of examples from [jetson-ai-lab](https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/)

Here are some examples that can be run:

## TODO List

- [ ] check disk space enough or not before run
- [ ] allow to setting some configs, such as `BASE_PATH`
- [ ] detect host environment and install what we need
- [ ] support jetson-containers update
- [ ] all type jetson support checking list
- [ ] better table to show example's difference
- [ ] try jetpack 6.0
