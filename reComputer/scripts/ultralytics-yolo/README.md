## Introduction üìò
This project enables you to deploy and experience all task models of Ultralytics YOLO on NVIDIA Jetson Orin devices with a single command. By accessing [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) on your local machine or within the same LAN, you can quickly start using Ultralytics YOLO. You can also upload your own trained models and test them with images, videos, or real-time camera feeds.

All models implemented in this project are from the official [Ultralytics Yolo](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics?tab=readme-ov-file#models).

## Quickstart ‚ö°

### Installation via PyPI (Recommended) üêç
1. Install the package:
    ```sh
    pip install jetson-examples
    ```

2. Restart your reComputer:
    ```sh
    sudo reboot
    ```

3. Run Ultralytics YOLO on Jetson with one command:
    ```sh
    reComputer run ultralytics-yolo
    ```

## Notes üìù
- The first time you start the code for detection, there will be a wait of at least 30 seconds for loading; this is normal.
- To stop detection at any time, press the Stop button.
- When accessing the WebUI from other devices within the same LAN, use the URL: `http://{Jetson_IP}:5001`.
