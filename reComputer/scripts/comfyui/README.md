## **Introduction** üìò
[ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) will let you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface. 
In this project, you can quickly deploy ComfyUI on Nvidia Jetson Orin devices with one click. 



## **Key Features**:
- **One-click installation and configuration support for Nvidia Jetson Orin devices.**
- **GPU acceleration to optimize the performance of stable diffusion pipelines.**
- Nodes/graph/flowchart interface to experiment and create complex Stable Diffusion workflows without needing to code anything.
- Fully supports SD1.x, SD2.x, [SDXL](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/sdxl/), [Stable Video Diffusion](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/video/), [Stable Cascade](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/stable_cascade/), [SD3](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/sd3/) and [Stable Audio](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/audio/)
- [Flux](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/flux/)
- Asynchronous Queue system
- Many optimizations: Only re-executes the parts of the workflow that changes between executions.
- Smart memory management: can automatically run models on GPUs with as low as 1GB vram.

  For other features, please refer to the original project [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI).

  Workflow examples can be found on the [Examples page](https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/)

## **Quickstart** ‚ö°

### Modify Docker Daemon Configuration (Optional)
To enhance the experience of quickly loading models in Docker, you need to add the following content to the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:

```json
{
  "default-runtime": "nvidia",
  "runtimes": {
    "nvidia": {
      "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
      "runtimeArgs": []
    }
  },
  "storage-driver": "overlay2",
  "data-root": "/var/lib/docker",
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "100m",
    "max-file": "3"
  },
  "no-new-privileges": true,
  "experimental": false
}
```

After modifying the `daemon.json` file, you need to restart the Docker service to apply the configuration:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

### **Installation via PyPI (Recommended)** üêç
1. Install the package:
    ```sh
    pip install jetson-examples
    ```

2. Restart your reComputer:
    ```sh
    sudo reboot
    ```

3. Run ComfyUI with one command:
    ```sh
    reComputer run comfyui
    ```
- **Input Dir**: Mount the input directory in Docker to the host directory `~/ComfyUI/input`.
- **Output Dir**: Mount the output directory in Docker to the host directory `~/ComfyUI/output`.

- **Models Dir**: Mount the models directory in Docker to the host directory `~/ComfyUI/models`.
